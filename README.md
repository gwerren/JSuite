JSuite
======

JSuite is a work in progress collection of C# projects for working with JSON.

JSON Data Mapper
----------------

The first (and currently only) project in JSuite is a mapper that defines a simple language to transform a source JSON object into a target one.

This project includes a full parser for a simple language to define the mappings, all written in C#.

For more details and a full language specification visit [my blog](https://gwerren.com/Projects/jsonDataMapper).
